java override annotation useless modern ides
just java override annotation actually useless programming decent ide yes understand override annotation prevents accidentally overriding super method misspelling method name messing method parameters however common sense tells unlikely happen modern ides following reasons ide shows marker small icon left side editor indicates whether method overridden overriding therefore explicit override annotation needed show override intention rename method see override marker never ever edit method name directly instinctively reach keyboard shortcut opens ide renaming assistant likewise intend change method signature see override marker instinctively use ide method signature assistant instead hand except simple cases method names signatures thus almost always changed correctly adding override annotations becomes opinion little paranoid useless safety check spreading final place sure write java code notepad whatever override annotation obviously helps point modern ide increase safety provided annotation worth decrease readability opinions

experience designing large systems even smaller best approach think terms components rather classes will allow break problems smaller mostly independent pieces example will component sole responsibility will bring data application processing component will need able deal multiple data sources etc becomes sub system design independently rest application deals specific problem smaller whole sub problems still larger keep breaking sub compoennts implementation components becomes almost trivial point start bringing notion classes enough visibility protagonists system short put lot emphasis separation concerns isolating sub problems sub components also isolate solutions makes easier correct design mistakes replace implementations without impacting entire system just two cents

quite already answered specific points raised ll try take look second larger picture one must fundamental differences java works primarily values java works primarily references example something like java reference object type actual object type refer normally something like new however defines object type just reference object use object directly via reference pointer disguise although may initially seem like fairly trivial difference effects substantial pervasive one effect probably important case java returning value involve copying object just involves copying reference value normally presumed extremely inexpensive probably importantly completely safe never throw exception re dealing directly values instead object re just returning reference existing object re returning object value usually form copy object state course also possible reference pointer want make happen make explicit standard containers anything even heavily oriented toward working values rather references add value collection gets added copy value passed get something back get copy value container among things means returning value might cheap safe just like java also expensive throw exception programmer wants store pointers certainly language doesn require like java since returning object expensive throw containers standard library generally built around ensuring work reasonably well copying expensive importantly work correctly even copying throws exception basic difference design accounts differences ve pointed quite well

immutable persistent list java
pet project trying implement immutable list data structure java minimizing copies much possible know google collections since list manipulations just new copies old list come two different approaches problem based doubly linked lists like every list consists tuple head tail first let examine simple case appending prepending element list resulting list since iterating list happens head tail won know anything new element prepended appended gets interesting try insert remove arbitrary element list indexed elements approach every list unique sequential id starting every element array prev next pointers corresponding list ids removing element3 list id prev next pointers respectively id list element2 element4 altered reflect result requested operation element1 remains unaltered iterating list index order obtain correct prev next pointers max elementidcount used compute correct index element1 element2 iterating id example adding replacing elements done way also except element id arrays need resized happen relatively infrequently big problem course garbage collection element added list never going released references modified versions original list released kind remedied making copy whole list every modifications example kind list especially well suited code constructs like since one reference list held given time iterator approach approach abusing iterators order make resulting list look like expected modified version modified immutable list holds reference source list additional tuple operation element position like iterator calls source list iterator case except encounters element modified added removed replaced case returns element continues source iterator obvious disadvantage nested iterator depth grows every modified version list means making raw copy every now necessary well anybody suggestions may improved also pointers data structures invented 60s may useful welcome

suggestions please post compilable example sscce don put much logic paintcomponent don allocate data method purpose painting prepare array numbers advance min int math random max min always since int math random always zero cast result ie min int math random max min wrap sorting process thread timer wait iterations call repaint paint intermediate results wrapping swing timer cleaner preferable posted code may easier faster dump whole logic selectionsort thread see tutorial examples also see looks like drawpass draws rectangles upside example uses existing code minimal changes
